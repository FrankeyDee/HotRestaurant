# HotRestaurant
## Initial Instructions

Today you will be building a Node / Express based web applications for handling reservation requests.

Your application will be made up of two parts: 
1) A front-end set of HTML/CSS/JS pages for entering and viewing data and 
2) A back-end composed of Node/Express and basic JS for storing, updating, and relaying reservation data.

Spend the time necessary to map this application out. Consider the concepts we've covered in class so far:

* Servers
* Routing
* APIs
* AJAX (GET and POST Requests)

You should be referencing the code from the previous Star Wars application.

Feel encouraged to use the following application as a reference: <http://hot-restaurant-fsf.herokuapp.com/>

Note: We know this is a hard activity. We know you aren't yet comfortable with Node or Express. But push yourself. The best way to learn is to push through the discomfort and BUILD! Ask for help when you need it. We're here to help you through the process.

## Phase I - For this first phase, aim to write out the pieces that will need to be programmed to create the functionality of your application. Try to break it into 6-7 pieces

* Create the front-end (visuals) for home page, reservation form, and reservation views.

* Create a basic server using Express.JS

* Create a few array variables that will hold the data

* Create a set of routes for getting and posting table data

* Create a set of routes for displaying the HTML pages

* Use JavaScript to make GET and POST requests from users to the Express server

## Phase II - For this second phase, aim to complete the following

* Backend Team:

Create a basic Express server.

Your server at this point should do the BARE MINIMUM. (Effectively, it should just say: "Listening at PORT 3000" when the command node server.js is run.)

* Frontend Team:

Create three HTML files one called home.html, another called tables.html, and another called reserve.html. Use dummy data and create pages similar to the one shown to you on the sample Hot Reservation webpage.
All: If you finish early, begin thinking about how the Data, API, and Routes should look.
